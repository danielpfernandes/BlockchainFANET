  <p class="help-text">
    NMEA Generator is an
    <a href="https://github.com/dassencio/nmeagen">open-source</a> drawing tool
    for generating GPS logs in
    <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm">NMEA</a> format. Its
    primary purpose is to make it easy to draw a path representing a person
    walking or driving around while carrying a GPS device which measures their
    current position at regular time intervals (e.g. once per second). After the
    path is drawn, its representation as a sequence of NMEA sentences can be
    generated and downloaded as a text file.

  <p class="help-topic"><a href="#">Adding single points</a></p>
  <div class="help-text">
    <p>
      The "Add point" tool is selected by default when the NMEA Generator is
      started. When you click on the map using this tool, a point is added to
      your path at the location you clicked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A point represents a position measured using a GPS device being carried
      around. The time elapsed between two consecutive points is always the same
      and equal to one second by default, but this can be changed under "Global
      settings".
    </p>

  <p class="help-topic"><a href="#">Deleting a point</a></p>
  <p class="help-text">
    To delete a point, select the "Delete point" tool and click on the point you
    wish to delete.
  </p>

  <p class="help-topic">
    <a href="#">Deleting all points (clearing the map)</a>
  </p>
  <p class="help-text">
    To delete all points, simply reload the application. The map view will be
    preserved, so you will not lose the location you are currently working on.
    All other settings (e.g. the GPS frequency) will however not be preserved.
  </p>

  <p class="help-topic"><a href="#">Moving a point manually</a></p>
  <p class="help-text">
    The "Move point" tool can be used to manually move points around. To move a
    point, click on it first to select it: the point will then start following
    the mouse cursor. Clicking once again will release the point at its current
    position.

      Setting latitude and longitude values for a point
    </a>
  </p>
  <p class="help-text">
    The "Edit point" tool allows you to directly set the latitude and longitude
    values for a point. First, select a point, then you will be able to change
    its latitude and longitude values on the menu (left side). Pressing the
    "Enter" key will move the point to the new specified location. To release
    the point, click anywhere on the map.

      Adding multiple points on a straight line
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="help-text">
    <p>
      With the "Multi-point line" tool, you can draw multiple points along a
      line with the same distance from each other. When you click on the map,
      all preview points will be added to your path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the time elapsed between two consecutive points is always the same,
      the "Multi-point line" tool represents motion along a straight line with
      constant velocity. The distance between consecutive points can be changed
      on the menu (left side), and the associated speed is shown right below it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="help-topic"><a href="#">Changing the GPS frequency</a></p>
  <div class="help-text">
    <p>
      By default, the time elapsed between two consecutive points on the map is
      one second. To change this, click on "Global settings" and modify the GPS
      frequency value. This value defines how many positions are obtained per
      second, so setting it to 10Hz means the time elapsed between two
      consecutive points will be 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds).
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPS frequency is a global setting, so changing its value will affect
      the associated speeds at all points. As an example, increasing the GPS
      frequency by a factor of 10 means all speeds will be increased by a factor
      of 10 as well.

  <p class="help-topic"><a href="#">Generating and loading NMEA files</a></p>
  <div class="help-text">
    <p>
      After drawing the desired path, you can generate a file containing a
      sequence of NMEA (<a
        href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#GGA"
        >GGA</a
      >, <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#GSA">GSA</a> and
      <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#RMC">RMC</a>)
      sentences representing the path drawn. To do that, click on the "Generate
      NMEA file" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also load an NMEA file generated with this or another application
      by clicking on the "Load NMEA file" button. The path represented by this
      file will then be drawn automatically on the map. The positions of the
      points are extracted from the GGA sentences.

      Downloading and loading coordinate files
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="help-text">
    <p>
      After drawing the desired path, you can generate a file containing its
      coordinates. The file will be in CSV format, with each line containing the
      coordinates of a point in the path (one latitude value and one longitude
      value separated by a comma). To do that, click on the "Download
      coordinates (CSV)" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also load a CSV file containing coordinates represented in this
      same format by clicking the "Load coordinates (CSV)" button. The path
      represented by this file will then be drawn automatically on the map.
